# Flutter starter kit

Built with clean architecture and domain driven design with clear seperation of `Presentation`, `Domain` and `Data` layers.

âœ… Presentation layer: Contains UI components like widgets and screens.

âœ… Domain layer: Contains
    ðŸ”† Data model / Data class to be used for the presentation layer
    ðŸ”† Mapper: Combines data from more than one data classes
    ðŸ”† BLoC: State management layer
    ðŸ”† Abstract repository
    ðŸ”† View model

âœ… Data layer: Contains the implementation of repository which defines the data source (local or remote)

âœ… Data flows: From data layer to presentation layer
âœ… Call flows: Presentation layer to data layer
