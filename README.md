# Flutter starter kit

Built with clean architecture and domain driven design with clear seperation of `Presentation`, `Domain` and `Data` layers.

âœ… Presentation layer: Contains

    ğŸ”† UI components like widgets and screens

    ğŸ”† BLoC: State management layer

    ğŸ”† View model

âœ… Domain layer: Contains

    ğŸ”† Data model / Data class to be used for the presentation layer

    ğŸ”† Mapper: Combines data from more than one data classes

    ğŸ”† Abstract repository

âœ… Data layer: Contains the implementation of repository which defines the data source (local or remote)

âœ… Data flows: From data layer to presentation layer

âœ… Call flows: Presentation layer to data layer
